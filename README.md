# MuSIH

MuSIH is an IoT school project (engineer institute grade).
It's a prototype of a smart heater with modular optional features.
The hardware used is a Raspberry Pi and a custom HAT with sensors (temperature, humidity, pressure, light, camera, motion) and actuators (LEDs, heating resistor).
The software is a webserver based on Flask (Python web framework) and Python for the backend and hardware managing, and Bootstrap for the CSS framework.
